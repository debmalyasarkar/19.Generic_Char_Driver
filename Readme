This driver makes use of the file-position field to read/write/seek
to any position of a virtual device buffer.

In Driver Side
--------------
We have to handle the updation of file-position variable in all of our
file operation functions.

In Application Side
-------------------
We can read, write at any position by using seek function.


Example
-------
Write 100 bytes
Read 100 bytes ------> Starting Index is 100 so we get garbage
Seek to Position 0
Read 100 bytes ------> We get the data that we have written previously

We can also implement a circular queue inside the driver and have separate 
read and write indices for management.
